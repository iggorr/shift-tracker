Before running the web application for the first time, a database has already
been initialised. 
In order to re-initialise the database, execute the following python statements in the current
directory:
>>> from web_app import init_db
>>> init_db()

The database comes prepopulated with two users:
username: igor
password: 12345

username: simon
password: 23456

Both users will have some data related to them for demonstration purposes,
however the database can be manipulated and updated through the web interace
